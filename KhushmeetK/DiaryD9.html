    <h1>Day 9 - Requirements and Tools for Web Optimizatio</h1>
    
    <div class="content-container">
        <h2>FR & NFR</h2>
        <p>We delved into the concepts of functional and non-functional requirements, which are crucial for the successful development of any web application:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Functional Requirements:</strong> These are the specific behaviors and functionalities that a system must exhibit. They describe what the system should do, including features, operations, and interactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Functional Requirements:</strong> These requirements specify how a system performs its functions. They include aspects such as performance, usability, reliability, and security. Non-functional requirements ensure that the system is user-friendly and meets various quality standards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tools for Web Optimization</h2>
        <p>We also explored various tools for web optimization that help enhance the performance and efficiency of web applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lighthouse:</strong> An open-source tool for auditing the performance, accessibility, and SEO of web pages. It provides actionable insights to improve the overall quality of the site.</li>
            <li><strong>GTmetrix:</strong> A tool that analyzes the speed of your web pages and offers suggestions for optimization based on various performance metrics.</li>
            <li><strong>CDN (Content Delivery Network):</strong> A network of servers distributed geographically to deliver web content to users more efficiently by reducing latency and load times.</li>
            <li><strong>Google PageSpeed Insights:</strong> This tool evaluates the performance of a web page on both mobile and desktop devices, providing suggestions for optimizing load times and overall user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Image Optimization:</strong> Techniques used to reduce the file size of images without compromising quality, enhancing load times and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>NVDA Screen Reader:</strong> A free and open-source screen reader that allows visually impaired users to interact with web content, highlighting the importance of accessibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Minification:</strong> The process of removing unnecessary characters from CSS and JavaScript files to reduce their size and improve load times.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Practical </h2>
        <p>In our practical session, we utilized several of the above tools to optimize our web project. The focus was on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance Auditing:</strong> Using Lighthouse to evaluate our website's performance and identify areas for improvement.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed Analysis:</strong> Leveraging GTmetrix and Google PageSpeed Insights to analyze load times and get optimization recommendations.</li>
            <li><strong>Image Optimization:</strong> Implementing techniques to compress images on our web pages, ensuring faster load times without sacrificing quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility Testing:</strong> Using the NVDA screen reader to ensure our web content is accessible to all users, highlighting areas where improvements were needed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
        <p>Through this practical experience, we gained valuable insights into how web optimization tools can significantly enhance the performance and usability of our web projects. Understanding both functional and non-functional requirements is essential in delivering high-quality applications that meet user needs effectively. We emphasized the importance of continuous optimization and user-centric design in web development.</p>
